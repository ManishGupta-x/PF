              Hey there ðŸ‘‹! I&apos;m Manish Gupta â€” a passionate Software Engineer who&apos;s been coding since 2018. I&apos;ve always been curious about solving problems through code, which might be making me a little lazier every dayâ€¦ but hey, if it works, why not!
              <br /><br />
              I consider myself an ambivert â€” someone who enjoys both deep solo focus and engaging with the right company .
              <br /><br />
              A melophile at heart, I absolutely love blending music with my coding sessions. My journey began with C++ and Competitive Programming, which I pursued seriously for over two years. Eventually, I shifted gears to Web Development, diving deep into the MERN stack.
              <br /><br />
              One of the most exciting phases of my journey has been working with <a

              </a>, where I built their website, back-office dashboard, and a complete POS system â€” powering restaurant chains and their delivery networks.
